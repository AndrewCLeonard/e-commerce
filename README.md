        -   Integer
        -   Doesn't allow null values
        -   Set as primary key
        -   Uses auto increment
    -   `category_name`
        -   String
        -   Doesn't allow null values

-   `Product`

    -   `id`
        -   Integer
        -   Doesn't allow null values
        -   Set as primary key
        -   Uses auto increment
    -   `product_name`
        -   String
        -   Doesn't allow null values
    -   `price`
        -   Decimal
        -   Doesn't allow null values
        -   Validates that the value is a decimal
    -   `stock`
        -   Integer
        -   Doesn't allow null values
        -   Set a default value of 10
        -   Validates that the value is numeric
    -   `category_id`
        -   Integer
        -   References the category model's id

-   `Tag`

    -   `id`
        -   Integer
        -   Doesn't allow null values
        -   Set as primary key
        -   Uses auto increment
    -   `tag_name`
        -   String

-   `ProductTag`

    -   `id`
        -   Integer
        -   Doesn't allow null values
        -   Set as primary key
        -   Uses auto increment
    -   `product_id`
        -   Integer
        -   References the product model's id
    -   `tag_id`
        -   Integer
        -   References the tag model's id

## Associations

-   `Product` belongs to `Category`, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.
-   `Category` has many `Product` models.
-   `Product` belongs to many `Tag` models. Using the `ProductTag` through model, allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products.
-   `Tag` belongs to many `Product` models.

## Lessons Learned

-   Configure the Sequelize ORM in a Node.js application.

    -   Set up the application to use Sequelize to manage SQL data.
    -   Use environment variables to protect sensitive data.
    -   Create a user table using Sequelize models.
    -   Create all of the server endpoints using RESTful API standards to work with the User modelâ€™s data.

-   Create models for categories, products, and tags in a relational database and a through table that will connect the product and tag models.
-   Define and implement CRUD methods, using Sequelize to interact with your models in each API endpoint through proper RESTful commands (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
-   Create and implement Sequelize associations to join tables.
-   Use environment variables to protect sensitive data, such as your MySQL username and password.

### Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

-   convert data between incompatible type systems using OOP principles
